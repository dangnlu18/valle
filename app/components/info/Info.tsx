                <p>Meet Nemanja and Marissa—casas MILU is named after our kids, Milan and Luka. We started this project in 2021. We were in valle one night, and our kids were up way past their bed time. We were all enjoying the hot tub and pool. We were drinking amazing wine and star gazing. The sky was covered with a blanket of stars. That is when we realized, we wanted a place of our own, in this beautiful region—to enjoy a time and again. After 10 years of consistently visiting Valle de Guadalupe, and discovering this unbelievable land and its people, we began looking for land. Our journey of building our little getaway began.

This project is a culmination of over 30 years of combined experience in the food, wine, hospitality, and customer service industries. We both relish over good food and wine, therefore starting a business in Valle de Guadalupe was of good fortune. The idea of opening up our weekend getaway to others was natural. We thought, let’s bring our wealth of knowledge to our guests.

The concept is simple—we want you to come and stay at our property, relax, connect, or disconnect, and enjoy the treasures of this remarkable region. At CASAS MILU we offer comfort lodging, fine wine tastings, and culinary experiences. We also offer services for you to explore all of what valle has to offer.
